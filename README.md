We have  developed the SSA based on the guidelines and the examples in the Interconnect Project Resources in Python the SSA following the blueprints and the examples found at Interconnect GitLabs, https://gitlab.inesctec.pt/interconnect-public/service-specifc-adapters/-/tree/main/project-SSAs/INESCTEC-EnergyAppRecommender?ref_type=heads and https://gitlab.inesctec.pt/interconnect-public/interoperable-recommender-tso.
The dataset that we retrieve from the Interoperable Recommender is the following: 
{ Country;
  Date/Hour;
  risk_evaluation;
  risk_level;
}
